# Deep Alpha System Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Deep Alpha System. This project provides an exploratory environment for machine learning applications in financial markets, focusing on data ingestion, storage, feature engineering, and (eventually) trading strategy development.

This documentation is designed to help you understand the system's architecture, set up your environment, use its various components, and contribute to its development.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the project, the best place to start is the **Quick Start Guide**:

*   **[01 - Quick Start Guide](./01_quick_start.md)**: A step-by-step tutorial to get the system up and running, including database initialization and initial data fetching.

<!-- ## Core Components & Guides

Dive deeper into specific parts of the system:

*   **[02 - Data Ingestion](./02_data_ingestion.md)**: Learn about how the system fetches, standardizes, and stores market data (symbols, klines, order books).
*   **[03 - Feature Engineering](./03_feature_engineering.md)**: Understand the feature engineering pipeline, how to define feature sets using YAML, and how to create custom feature calculators.
*   **[04 - Database Schema](./04_database_schema.md)**: Explore the structure of the TimescaleDB database, including tables, hypertables, continuous aggregates, and materialized views.
*   **[05 - Web UI Guide](./05_web_ui.md)**: Instructions on how to use the experimental Flask-based web interface for data visualization.
*   **[06 - Makefile Commands](./06_makefile_commands.md)**: A detailed reference for all available `make` targets for managing the system.
*   **[07 - Troubleshooting](./07_troubleshooting.md)**: Common issues and how to resolve them. -->
